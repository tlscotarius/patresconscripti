      <p>
         In an attempt to maintain a steady pace to the game, the official policy on the
         sending of orders will be as follows.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         No reminder notices will be sent to players when their orders are needed.
         Instead, there will be a 2 day (i.e. 48 hour) deadline for all orders from the
         point in which the GM's initial request for orders is made.  The following
         will be the default orders for anyone who has not sent in their orders by
         the deadline.
         </p>
         
         <h4>Revenue Phase</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>no contribution of monies to the state</li>
         <li>no transfer of monies to other players</li>
         <li>no transfer of monies to other senators</li>
         <li>no transfer of monies to the faction treasury</li>
         <li>governors are not corrupt</li>
         <li>provincial forces will be built evenly with odd numbers going to legions</li>
         </ul>
         
         
         <h4>Forum Phase</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>faction leader will attempt to attract a knight</li>
         <li>no money will be spent to attract a knight</li>
         <li>no persuasion attempts will be made</li>
         <li>no change of faction leader</li>
         <li>no sponsoring of games</li>
         <li>will not resist persuasion attempts of other players</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h4>Senate Phase</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>faction abstains on votes  
            <ul>
            <li>Exception: if the player is the initiator of the proposal, then his faction votes yes</li>
            <li>Exception: if proposal is for a land bill, then the faction votes yes</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
         <li>voting order starts with the player after the Presiding Magistrate and ends with the Presiding Magistrate</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h4>Revolution Phase</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>no cards played</li>
         <li>no cards traded</li>
         <li>victorious commanders will relinquish command of their forces to Rome</li>
         <li>governors will not revolt</li>
         <li>loyal legions will not be disbanded</li>
         <li>if player holds more than 5 cards then the least valuable cards will be discarded so
         that only 5 cards remain (Note: GM will decide which cards are the "least valuable")</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>
         Players who are conducting negotiations/discussions on a particular
         issue/proposal within the game will be exempt from the deadline (assuming
         that their negotiations/discussions are related to the current issue/proposal).
         If it appears that negotiations have ended (i.e. no communications after 2 days),
         then I will notify those who were partaking in the negotiations that they have
         2 days to send in their orders and/or votes.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         Similarly, players who are unable to participate in the game (e.g. vacations,
         holidays, etc.) will be exempt from the deadline, and are to send in their orders
         when they return.  In this case players must notify the GM that they will be away,
         and the approximate amount of time they will be away.  If necessary, the game will
         be put on-hold until the player returns.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         Finally, if players need more time to decide on their orders, then they may request
         an extension to the deadline by sending an email to the GM asking for an extension.  At that time, the GM
         will decide upon the duration of the deadline extension.
         </p>
