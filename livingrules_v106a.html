              <p>
              REPUBLIC OF ROME is a game that captures 250 years of political history during the Roman Republic, from its appearance on the world stage 
              around the time of the 1st Punic War (264 BC) through its eventual collapse into civil war with the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. Players 
              control factions composed of the leading Senatorial families <span class="text-living">who</span> compete for state offices, military commands, economic concessions and 
              new adherents. Each player is attempting to become the dominant political force in Rome. However, the Senate must also attend to the affairs of 
              state in a hostile world, necessitating a certain amount of cooperation in the prosecution of wars and the maintenance of public contentment. 
              Failure to do so, especially at the outset when Rome is most vulnerable, may result in the collapse of the Republic. Therefore, the players 
              must <span class="text-living">not only</span> out maneuver one another, but <span class="text-living">also</span> defeat the game itself, which constitutes an ever-present opponent scheming to divide 
              and defeat them all. Players are advised to keep the threat of the downfall of the Republic foremost in mind and stand ready to cooperate for the 
              good of the state. Otherwise, the most likely winner will be the game, and all players will be put to the sword!
              </p>
              <p>
              WINNING: There are multiple ways to win REPUBLIC OF ROME. One common way is for the Senators in your Faction to accumulate the most 
              combined Influence by the end of the game. However, if a single Senator can accumulate enough Influence to be elected or appointed Consul 
              for Life, this will <span class="text-living">usually</span> result in a victory for his Faction. The most difficult and most dramatic way to win is to gain the allegiance of the 
              formidable Roman Legions, Revolt against the State and attempt to take the Senate by force! For more details on Victory Conditions see <a href="#Rule_1.12.1">1.12.<span class="text-living">1</span></a>.
              </p>
              <p>
              LOSING: Be ever watchful as Rome can fall <span class="text-living">in</span> a myriad of ways! If the State goes Bankrupt due to poor fiscal policy, all players lose. If the 
              citizens of Rome ever Revolt due to the poor stewardship of the Senate, all the players lose. Finally, if, at the end of any turn, Rome is beset by 
              four Active Wars, the Republic will collapse under the strain and Rome will be no more! For more details on the Losing Conditions see <a href="#Rule_1.12.2">1.12.<span class="text-living">2</span></a>.

              attributes that increase a Faction’s voting power and Influence. The

                  During the course of the Game 
                  players will conduct negotiations and make deals. Deals made 
                  publicly, for all players to hear, are considered binding and must 
                  be honored. If one party to the deal is unable to fulfill his or her side 
                  of the bargain when required, the wronged party can rescind those 
                  aspects of the deal that are still being held (and are therefore 
                  retrievable). However, a player may not back out of a Public 
                  Agreement simply because it is inconvenient. Virtually anything that 
                  does not circumvent the rules can be agreed to in such a deal. However 
                  deals involving the distribution of the Rome and Field Consul offices 
                  amongst the two candidates are never enforceable, nor is any deal 
                  involving an Assassination attempt, or agreements to Revolt or to 
                  remain loyal to Rome. If there is disagreement as to the terms of a 
                  Public Agreement, the other players must honestly and impartially 
                  arbitrate the disagreement, by majority vote if needed.

                  propose Julius for Censor and vote for his election. Eve does as promised. 
                  However, the Rome Consul calls upon Chris to vote first for his own election, 
                  whereas Chris wants to vote last to assure passage. The measure is defeated 
                  when Paul spends money to buy votes to defeat it. Chris protests that the bargain 
                  was not kept, but the other players agree with Eve that nothing was said about 
                  a specific voting order and the trade stands. Eve is entitled to 15 Talents from 
                  Chris during the next Revenue Phase. Chris gets nothing except heartburn.</span>

              Presiding Magistrate. The HRAO will not be the Presiding Magistrate 
              during Prosecutions (<a href="#Rule_1.09.41">1.09.41</a>) or after stepping down as a result of a 
              unanimous proposal defeat (<a href="#Rule_1.09.144">1.09.144</a>). The Presiding Magistrate has 
              complete control over the procedures of the Senate and conducts 
              all business. He may recognize Senators in any order he wishes and 
              may call for the votes of each Faction in any order. He alone makes 
              nominations and proposals without the use of a Tribune card 
              (<a href="#Rule_1.09.151">1.09.151</a>), and he may break off discussion on any proposal by calling 
              for an immediate vote. Any player who ignores his demand for an 
              immediate vote is considered to have abstained and loses his right 
              to vote on that proposal. After all elections (including Governors) 
              and Prosecutions, he may close the meeting at any time there is no 
              unresolved proposal on the floor by <span class="text-living">saying</span> “the Senate is adjourned.” 
              If the Presiding Magistrate dies as a result of an Assassination or

                  Unrest Level is not further affected. The surviving Provincial Forces

                  augmenting its Strength, these Provinces stay allied until defeated by 
                  a non-Governor Commander. In this case, the defeated War does not 
                  incur an Unprosecuted War penalty during the Population Phase. It 
                  will stay Inactive until attacked by Rome or made Active by another 
                  Matching War or Leader. If there is already an Active Matching War 
                  or Leader in the Forum, the War is shuffled into the top six cards of 
                  the deck. If there are only six cards left, it is shuffled into the top of the 
                  next deck (in the case of an Extended Scenario) or discarded outright 
                  (if this is the last deck). A Provincial Victory has no effect on the 
                  Unrest Level and no Spoils of War are gained. Governors that win a
                  Provincial Victory (Land or Naval) receive standard Influence and 
                  Popularity gains. Veteran Legions are created from Garrison Legions 
                  (Provincial Armies cannot become Veteran) and owe allegiance to the 
                  Governor. A result of “Victory” in a Naval Battle that still requires 
                  a Land Battle results in a Naval Victory marker being placed on the 
                  War, and the War is considered Prosecuted for that turn.

                  one Senator, belonging to any player (including himself), to represent 
                  him in the trial as an Advocate. A Senator must be in Rome and 
                  cannot hold the position of Censor or Prosecutor in order to be eligible 
                  to be an Advocate. The Censor must give the Accused a reasonable 
                  amount of time to obtain the services of an Advocate. If no Advocate 
                  comes forward to represent the Accused, he is considered to be his 
                  own Advocate and is representing himself.

              <i>
                  REPUBLIC OF ROME offers three main scenarios which cover Rome’s rise 
                  from a city-state on the banks of the Tiber to an empire that dominated the 
                  entire Mediterranean. The main scenarios are labeled the Early, Middle, and 
                  Late Republic. The Early Republic features a fragile Republic beset by the 
                  most powerful enemies it would ever have to face, and the players must work 
                  hard simply to survive. The Middle Republic is a period of growth, in which a 
                  stable Rome absorbs more and more provinces, and the threats it faces slowly 
                  become more internal than external. The Late Republic portrays the final 
                  cataclysmic days of the Republic, as powerful politicians face-off for control 
                  of the state while Italy is wracked by dissent, Civil War threatens, and the 
                  Roman Republic lurches towards the Roman Empire.

                  It is generally suggested that new players should start with the Early 
                  Republic scenario (<a href="#Rule_3.01.1">3.01.1</a>). Even though it is the toughest for the Republic, 
                  it plays in 4 hours or so for most groups. It uses the fewest rules and is an 
                  excellent way to become familiar with the dynamics of the game. The Middle 
                  and Late Republic scenarios each take a bit longer to play than the previous 
                  scenario, although the very real threat of the Republic becoming an Empire 
                  can cut the Late Republic short.

                  the Basic Game. The Player has many seeming advantages over his 
                  predictable Neutral opponents due to his greater freedom of action 
                  and ability to inspect their Intrigue cards and Faction Treasury. 
                  Balancing this somewhat is the burden of keeping the Republic 
                  afloat. The Neutrals tend to be self-serving so the Player must lead 
                  the way, often spending not to enrich his Faction but to safeguard 
                  the Republic. For instance, it is not unusual for the Plutocrats to use 
                  their head start as the Temporary Rome Consul to forge a monopoly 
                  on the Censor as long as they remain in the Ruling Coalition. The 
                  Player may find it necessary to sacrifice his own Spoils pick to give 
                  a Consulship to a lesser Senator among the Plutocrats in order to 
                  qualify someone else in that Faction for Censor and thereby slow the 
                  Influence gain of the original Temporary Rome Consul. Indeed, the 
                  Player may consider it a moral victory if he can keep the Republic 
                  intact until Scenario end regardless of how his own Faction fares.

          <p class="col-md-12">REPUBLIC OF ROME was always known to have an infamous long list of errata, both official and unofficial. The changes listed below reflect 
              actual changes between this latest edition compared to the original game combined with the official Avalon Hill errata. Differences between 
              the original and the current rulebooks that are not reflected below are likely detailed in official errata compiled over the last twenty years by 
              fans and are available (with some searching) on the internet. Keep in mind that terminology changes and cosmetic changes have not been listed 
              here. Only mechanical changes to the game are listed.
          </p>

          <ol>
              <li> The game now ends in the Forum Phase when the “Era Ends” Event is drawn instead of at the end of the turn after the last card is drawn from 
                  the deck. The change results in slightly different deck construction as well as changes any rule or card that mentioned reshuffling the deck.
                  <div>Reason for Change: To limit the artificial Assassination free-for-all that occurs at the end of the game.</div></li>
              <li> Revenue transfers between players moved to the Personal Income step in the Revenue Phase.
                  <div>Reason for Change: To simplify the Revenue Phase and to ensure that players could not get out of Public Agreements by contributing to 
                  the State first.</div></li>
              <li>Corrupt Governors can now be prosecuted even when recalled in the Senate Phase.
                  <div>Reason for Change: To remove the “loophole” where Corrupt Governors could avoid at least the threat of a prosecution.</div></li>
              <li>Factions with two opposing Statesmen may now not voluntarily abandon one of them.
                  <div>Reason for Change: This is to remove numerous rules questions that arise from “abandoning” a Senator – something that is extremely rare.</div></li>
              <li>Removed the chart and DR for determining how many Provincial Armies vs. Legions are taken for battle losses in a mixed force and replaced 
                  them with a pattern of 1 Legion for every 2 Provincial Armies.
                  <div>Reason for Change: To simplify the way losses are taken in Provincial Wars.</div></li>
              <li>Removed the official “Banker” position.
                  <div>Reason for Change: Players may now hand out money from the Bank as they see fit. If they would like a “Banker” role they may 
                  appoint one amongst themselves.</div></li>
              <li>The Exile rules have been removed.
                  <div>Reason for Change: Exiles were (for the most part) never used and didn’t contribute anything to game play.</div></li>
              <li>The loss of Legions in battle incurs a minor Popularity loss.
                  <div>Reason for Change: To simultaneously allow an alternative method besides minor Prosecutions to lower the Popularity on highly 
                  popular Senators and to more accurately simulate the consequences of military troop losses.</div></li>
              <li>The Temporary Rome Consul is no longer assigned to the Senator with the lowest ID# but instead is randomly determined.
                  <div>Reason for Change: To limit the advantage of the player controlling ID#1 at the very beginning of the Early Republic Scenario. </div></li>
              <li>Players now track who is available for minor/major prosecutions with markers and by adjusting concession cards.
                  <div>Reason for Change: This was included to remove the memory portion of the Censors job ( i.e., “Who is eligible for prosecution again?”) 
                  but it does add some additional fiddliness. Players as a group can decide to use these markers as they see fit.</div></li>
              <li>Talents in the Faction Treasury cannot be used to aid the attacker of a Persuasion Attempt.
                  <div>Reason for Change: The original rulebook and player aids had contradictions on this subject. Subsequent AH errata confirmed that they 
                  could aid the attacker though much of the REPUBLIC OF ROME community assumed this was an incorrect answer and never played this
                  way due to the perceived potential negative effects and loops holes that this created. We have decided that allowing additional Factions to 
                  aid the attacker of a persuasion attempt gives an excessive advantage to the attacker and significantly increases the chaos of persuasions 
                  attempts.</div></li>
              <li>Matching Wars Time Delay Variant Rule is made Official Rule (Imminent Wars).
                  <div>Reason for Change: The AH General magazine released a variant that delayed a Matching War from becoming Active immediately if 
                  there already was a Matching War of the same type in play. This extremely popular variant rule was considered by most players
                  to be necessary in order to have a fighting chance in many of the harder scenarios. It has since become standard in most games and has 
                  now been made official. These delayed wars are now referred to as Imminent Wars.</div></li>
              <li>Changing Faction Leader and Sponsoring Games are no longer either/or options.
                  <div>Reason for Change: Our view of the rule in which you could not Change Faction leaders if you Sponsored games was that it was 
                  arbitrary, anti-intuitive and takes players out of the immersion. After extensive debate internally and with the designer it was decided 
                  that taking this unusual restrictions out of the rules would have little to no impact and streamline a small but rather glaring oddity.</div></li>
              <li>Assignment/Reassignment of a Priest by the Pontifex is now optional.
                  <div>Reason for Change: The original wording indicated that the Pontifex must assign or reassign 1 Priest every turn. Unfortunately, 
                  sometimes the Pontifex would simply forget, leaving the players to wonder if they should just ignore the mistake or correct it 
                  immediately. Making this action optional removes this problem and should have no real effect on the game.</div></li>

              <p class="col-md-12">
                  Here you stand, wide-eye and innocent, about to leap into your first 
                  game of REPUBLIC OF ROME . . . the Early Republic scenario to 
                  boot. Good, it’s the toughest! You barely grasp the rules, but it is 
                  clear to you that this is not your average wargame. If you are playing 
                  with experience players, well, Bunky, you’re dead meat. Just try to 
                  pick an ally and stick with him for a while. As long as you’re making 
                  yourself useful, he’ll probably throw you an occasional bone. You 
                  probably won’t win, but at least you’ll have a say in who does. And 
                  who knows, maybe you’ll get lucky. You can also improve your 
                  chances by keeping the following pointers in mind:
              </p>
  
              <ol>
                  <li>Stick together! Unlike your average user-friendly game, this 
                      one’s a killer. It’s designed to tempt you and drag you down to your 
                      demise. Novices who play too aggressively will soon find themselves 
                      facing the choice of a glorious death on the spears of a hostile phalanx 
                      or a somewhat more sordid one at the hands of an angry mob.</li>
                  <li>Knock off the Punic and Macedonian Wars as soon as possible 
                      with as much force as you can bring to bear. Don’t get cute. If you 
                      fool around with stalemates until Matching Wars or Hannibal appear, 
                      all the co-operation in the world may not be enough. There is time 
                      enough to be devious once Carthage has been eliminated.</li>
                  <li>Build a big army early. Manpower shortages always seem to occur 
                      when the Active War count reaches critical mass.</li>
                  <li>Use your own funds to throw games—lots of them. This is better 
                      for the health of the State than land bills, and will make fewer enemies.</li>
                  <li>Don’t let Concessions sit in the Forum or your hand unused. Pass 
                      them out freely in exchange for favors. Above all, don’t play them 
                      on yourself until you’ve established your Popularity or guaranteed 
                      control of the Censor unless you want to get a first hand view of the 
                      receiving end of a Prosecution.</li>
                  <li>Try to win the game on points by exhausting the deck with a 
                      healthy Rome. Other methods are too volatile for a newcomer.</li>
                  <li>Don’t allow the others to take extra Initiatives cheaply, but insist on 
                      them yourself only when you have something to gain such as another 
                      Persuasion Attempt versus an attractive and vulnerable Senator. 
                      Otherwise, bank the difference while your opponents spend their 
                      money.</li>
                  <li>Beware the Temporary Rome Consul. As the only Senator with 
                      prior Consular experience he automatically becomes Censor on turn
                      1. Allowing his faction to continue in power may give him too big a 
                      lead to overcome. He may offer great payments in exchange for the 
                      necessary votes to retain a consulship among his faction. Don’t let 
                      him do it cheaply.</li>
                  <li>Stick together! I said it before but it bears repeating. Don’t make 
                      early enemies. Like RISK, the game is rarely won in the early going. 
                      With reasonable precautions, it should take at least six turns before 
                      anyone is in position to win. Bide your time and wait for your 
                      opportunity.</li>
              </ol>

              <p><strong>INTERMEDIATE</strong></p>
              <p class="col-md-12">
                  Now that you’ve played a few games, you’re probably ready to start 
                  cutting some throats, so let’s get a bit more specific.                    
              </p>
  
              <ol>
                  <li>Use your power as Rome Consul like a surgeon uses a scalpel. 
                      Think ahead. You should always have a plan not only for what you 
                      want to accomplish in this Senate phase, but the next one as well. 
                      By increasing your Popularity now or sending an opponent off to a 
                      province, you may make one of your Senators a likelier candidate for 
                      Consul next turn. You have tremendous power in your ability to put 
                      bills on the floor and control the order of voting. Always make your 
                      opponents vote first and your friends vote last. As consul, you 
                      should always have money in your Personal Treasury with which to 
                      carry close votes.</li>
                  <li>When making proposals, combine Governorships or Concession 
                      measures into a single bill to gain widespread support for their 
                      passage. Don’t be timid. Make offers. Politics is a game of greed at 
                      any level and every politician has his price. Don’t be afraid to cut 
                      yourself out of the deal in exchange for promised votes on other 
                      measures. Spend your Intrigue cards as bribes in exchange for 
                      needed votes or support. There is always a way to get what you want 
                      by creating the right circumstances.</li>
                  <li>If you have the best General, use him to win an early victory 
                      and then withdraw him from politics. You can then be a bit of an 
                      Obstructionist, voting against raising armies and the like in the hope 
                      that an unstable State will be forced to seek your services. A Dictator 
                      can often write his own ticket while fending off disaster.</li>
                  <li>Avoid the appearance of being in the lead. Even the weakest 
                      player can be in the best position as a compromise candidate when 
                      others are chasing a dominant faction. If cut out of the action by 
                      a dominant coalition, kill them with kindness…pick one leader and 
                      shower him with support. Only by creating a clear leader can you 
                      weaken his coalition and unite all against him.</li>
                  <li>Don’t look at a Governorship as an exile. It allows you to build a 
                      power base while relatively free of the dangers of being in Rome. 
                      Verres boasted that a third of his loot was reserved for his prosecutors, 
                      a third for the jurists, and a third for himself. A large Faction Treasury 
                      transferred to the returning Governor’s Personal Treasury upon his 
                      return to Rome can buy a lot of friends if need be.</li>
                  <li>Spend early cash to attract Knights. Spend late cash on bribes.</li>
              </ol>

              <p><strong>ADVANCED</strong></p>
              <p class="col-md-12">
                  By now you have realized, as one tester told me, that this game makes 
                  most look like CHUTES & LADDERS. I designed it for those who 
                  think DIPLOMACY is too tame. There are many subtle ways to gain 
                  advantage over even experienced players. Here are but a few:
              </p>
  
              <ol>
                  <li>Only in the Late Republic Scenario should you plan on a victory 
                      by conquest. Only in this scenario is it easy to get the necessary 
                      Legion allegiance to a Commander vs. the State. However, because 
                      of this and the lessened strength of foreign Wars, the Senate should 
                      be reluctant to entrust any Commander with a dominant Army. To 
                      overcome this, you’ll need to build a large Faction Treasury and pass 
                      the necessary Laws when you’re ready to strike.
                      </li>
                  <li>Use the power of the Censor. Always prosecute vulnerable 
                      Senators. Even the threat of prosecution is worth something…get 
                      value for your promise to withhold prosecution.</li>
                  <li>Always add to your Faction Treasury. It is the only thing that can’t 
                      be taken from you in a changing environment and it is the only source 
                      of power that cannot be readily counted and used against you.</li>
                  <li>Think deviously. So you want to be Censor. You can afford to be 
                      generous. Nominate your rival as Censor, but vote last. If it looks as 
                      though he will be elected, veto the proposal. One less candidate to 
                      worry about and if yours is the last eligible candidate, well…
                      </li>
                  <li>Once an opposing Senator reaches 21 Influence always be wary of 
                      a Consul for Life vote. Keep funds in your Personal Treasury to 
                      combat any such vote. If you have such a Senator, look for 
                      opportunities to swing such a vote by sending influential Senators 
                      out of Rome to fight wars or govern lucrative Provinces.</li>
                  <li>Go easy on the assassinations. They were not prevalent in Roman 
                      history and for that reason the penalties for invoking them have been 
                      made especially severe. In a well-played game, a player never plans 
                      to be an assassin…rather he plans how to force another player to be the 
                      assassin. For example, during a Consul for Life vote which appears as 
                      though it will be successful, the HRAO wields tremendous power by 
                      determining the order of vote. The last opposing player called upon 
                      to vote will have the choice of being an assassin or allowing the game 
                      to end. The faction with the most to lose should be forced to sit in that 
                      uncomfortable seat.</li>
                  <li>Use your imagination. There is no such thing as a bad Intrigue 
                      card, only bad players. For example, on the surface, the Julian Law 
                      card would seem to be detrimental to the faction which plays it. But 
                      when the Land Bills are exhausted, the Unrest Level is high, and a 
                      Manpower Shortage is in effect how much will your fellow players 
                      pay to see this card fall? Surely the next Consulship/Censorship can 
                      be yours.</li>
                  <li>Be flexible. There are many ways to win and the best ones are the 
                      least obvious. Just because one plan fails, all is not lost. An epidemic 
                      can turn a have-not into the new leader in a single turn. A player is 
                      never out of REPUBLIC OF ROME as long as he doesn’t give up.</li>

          <p class="col-md-12">
              The Roman Republic was born c. 509 B.C. when the young city-state 
              threw out its last king, Tarquin the Proud. The new state than spent 
              its first two centuries making the transition from aristocracy of birth 
              to oligarchy of wealthy (the Struggle of the Orders) and developing 
              the machinery of republican government. By 287 B.C. the finished 
              republican constitution had emerged.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The Republic possessed a hierarchy of annually elected magistrates, 
              the highest of which were the two consuls. They and the next rank of 
              officials, the praetors, were normally the only individuals with the 
              power to command military forces, but in times of crisis the consuls 
              and Senate could together nominate a dictator, who would in turn 
              choose an assistant, his master of horse. These temporary magistrates 
              could hold office for at most six months, but during their tenure, their 
              power was superior to that of the regular officials. The Senate might 
              also choose to extend the power of a consul or praetor beyond the 
              normal year in office by making him a proconsul or proprietor, both 
              of whom could command troops.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Important in domestic affairs were the two censors and the pontifex 
              maximus, the former elected for an eighteen-month term every five 
              years, the latter for life. The censors controlled the census and the 
              Senatorial roles, possessing the power to eject members from the 
              Senate, while the pontifex maximus headed Rome’s secular religious 
              establishment. Finally, there were the ten annually elected tribunes, 
              who possessed the important powers of initiating legislation and 
              vetoing any act of the government.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Of the Republic’s four citizen assemblies only two were of any 
              importance: the Centuriate, which elected the consuls, praetors 
              and censors, and the Tribal, which elected the tribunes and passed 
              legislation. The Senate was made up of ex-consuls and ex-praetors, 
              who held their seats for life, and until the last half century of the 
              Republic it had a membership of about 300. The Senate was simply an 
              advisory body and after 287 B.C had no actual constitutional power.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Rome of the Republic remained in theory a democracy, and the people 
              were the sovereign authority, electing, legislating, and declaring 
              war. But in actuality the Republic was controlled by an oligarchy of 
              wealth, centered in the Senate. The magistracies were theoretically 
              open to all citizens, but in practice were restricted to the wealthy, 
              who thus composed the Senate. Though it lacked any legal powers, 
              the Senatorial oligarchy was easily able to dominate the legislative 
              processes of the Tribal assembly, and the magistrates, who were 
              constitutionally independent, were in reality the executive arm of the 
              Senate.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Being of the same class (and being Romans), the Senatorial nobility 
              had a unity of purpose and action in its direction of Rome, but the 
              families who made up this ruling class were constantly struggling for 
              preeminence within the Senate. What motivated them was not so 
              much wealth or power, as the competition for the prestige gained by 
              serving Rome, and the goal of the Senatorial statesman was to excel 
              his colleagues in prestige and become recognized as the unofficial 
              “Dean of the Senate”—the princes senatus.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Until the last century of the Republic the Roman people were quite 
              content with the rule of the Senatorial oligarchy, which served the 
              state extremely well. While the internal restructuring was going on 
              in the fourth and fifth centuries, Rome managed to conquer and 
              unite the Italian peninsula, creating the power base for her overseas 
              adventures. She won mastery of the western Mediterranean by 
              destroying the power of Carthage (First Punic War 264-241 B.C., 
              Second Punic War 218-201 B.C.) and was then drawn into the Balkan 
              Peninsula by Philip V of Macedon, who had joined Hannibal in the war 
              on Rome (First Macedonian War 214-205 B.C.). Philip’s defeat in the
              Second Macedonian War (200-196 B.C.) quickly led to a confrontation 
              with the last great Mediterranean power, the Seleucid Empire in Asia, 
              and Antiochus III fared no better than Philip (192-189 B.C.). There 
              were many more wars to be fought, and the Romans had yet to occupy 
              most of the real estate of Europe and the Mediterranean, but after 189 
              B.C. the Republic no longer had any serious rivals for control of the 
              western world.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">On the domestic front, however, the eastern wars, following hard on 
              the heels of Hannibal’s devastating sojourn in Italy, created serious 
              social and economic problems, as what was essentially a city-state 
              government with a citizen militia struggled to meet the demands of 
              a growing empire. Major reform was needed, but the period had 
              also seen dramatic growth in the power of the Senatorial oligarchy, 
              which in the course of the second century looked more and more to 
              its own interests rather than those of the Republic. Even moderate 
              reform was resisted by a short-sighted and self-interested Senate, 
              and in 133 B.C. T. Sempronius Gracchus, using unprecedented, but 
              perfectly legal tactics, gained control of the Tribal assembly and began 
              a revolutionary assault on the traditional authority of the Senate.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">So began the Roman Revolution, a century long collapse of the 
              Republic that would end only in 31 B.C. Resisting any change was 
              the majority of the Senate, known as the Optimates; they had the 
              advantage of unity of purpose, wealth and extensive control of the 
              government machinery. Opposing them were the Populares, a mixed 
              bag of anti-Senatorial forces, usually led by the dissenting minority in 
              the Senate. The earliest leaders of the Populares, such as the Gracchi 
              brothers, were true reformers, but very quickly the attack on the 
              Optimates became simply an avenue for the politically ambitious, as 
              the reform movement degenerated into civil strife and finally into civil 
              war.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The Senate resisted the reform bill of T. Gracchus, but before his death 
              in a riot Gracchus had demonstrated that it was possible to gain at 
              least temporary control of the Tribal assembly and pass measures 
              against the wishes of the Senate. The weakness of the Senate—that all 
              its power was based on nothing more than custom—had been made 
              clear, while the Senate had shown itself unwilling to countenance 
              even the most moderate reform. G. Gracchus was perhaps more 
              politically minded than his brother and attempted in 123-122 B.C. to 
              build a more permanent anti-Senatorial base by attracting the support 
              of the Knights, the wealthy class of businessmen, who had until now 
              been essentially apolitical. In this he was essentially successful, but 
              his work was quickly undone when he and the rest of the Populares 
              leadership were killed in a Senate inspired riot.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The Senate had defended itself with violence, and it was not long before 
              the use of force was formalized and escalated by the introduction of 
              the military into politics. The last decades of the second century saw 
              the rise of G. Marius, an eminently successful general who rode his 
              popularity to leadership of the Populares and an unprecedented six 
              consulships in eight years. Marius, whose military reforms furthered 
              the professionalization of the legions, used his veterans in Rome 
              only as political workers and toughs, never as military units, but his 
              actions pointed the way to the emergence of the client army, whose 
              primary loyalty was to the commander rather than the state. The first 
              commander actually to bring legions into Rome itself was L. Cornelius 
              Sulla, who led the Senatorial counterattack in the 90’s and 80’s. Sulla 
              earned his military reputation and loyal veterans in the great allied 
              revolt (Social War 91-87 B.C.), which brought Roman citizenship to 
              the Italian allies, and in his victory over King Mithridates VI of Pontus 
              in Asia Minor (88-85 B.C.). When he returned from Asia he defeated 
              the Marian forces in Rome’s first civil war, and by the time of his death 
              in 78 B.C. the Senate seemed once again firmly in control.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">But appearances, especially in politics, can be deceiving. Violence 
              was now firmly embedded in the political system, and there were 
              too many ambitious men ready to follow the examples of Marius
              and Sulla. The rest of the Revolution can still be seen in terms of 
              Optimates and Populares, but the real contest was now among a group 
              of tremendously powerful individuals and ultimately their armies. 
              More and more, foreign policy became simply a reflection of domestic 
              struggles, as the political contenders sought military commands as a 
              way to gain money, reputations, and above all veteran armies for the 
              contest in Rome.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The next generation of leaders came from the ranks of Sulla’s own 
              lieutenants. Cn. Pompeius (Pompey the Great) and M. Licinius 
              Crassus both took advantage of military crises in Spain and Italy 
              (Sertorian War 80-72 B.C., Revolt of Spartacus 72-71 B.C.) to gain armies 
              with which they then intimidated the Senate. The Senate refused to 
              face reality and ally with Pompey and instead did everything to 
              drive him into the arms of Crassus, a rich Knight and natural leader 
              of the Populares. The two men began falling out during the 60’s, as 
              Pompey gained a greater (and largely unwarranted) military 
              reputation by clearing the Mediterranean of pirates and campaigning 
              in the east (Third Mithridatic War 72-66 B.C.). However, civil war 
              was averted by the young G. Julius Caesar, who in 60 B.C. brought 
              the two leaders and himself into a private political alliance: the First 
              Triumvirate. Caesar spent the 50’s conquering Gaul, and in 53 B.C. 
              Crassus got himself killed fighting the Parthians, thereby simplifying 
              the political situation. The showdown came in 49 B.C., when Caesar 
              invaded Italy, and was essentially over the following year, when a 
              defeated Pompey was assassinated in Egypt on the orders of the last 
              Ptolemy, Cleopatra VII.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The Republic was quite dead by 44 B.C., when Caesar was 
              assassinated, but Rome had to face the agony of one more civil war. 
              Caesar’s lieutenants, M. Antonius (Marc Antony) and M. Aemilius 
              Lepidus, and his grandnephew and personal heir, G. Octavious 
              (Octavian), formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 B.C. In the course of 
              the 30’s Lepidus was set aside. Octavian gained control of Italy and 
              the west and Antony established himself in the east in alliance with 
              Cleopatra. The war came and the Revolution ended in 31 B.C. with 
              the defeat and suicide of Antony and Cleopatra. In 27 B.C. Octavian 
              began laying the foundation of the Principate, an autocracy clothed in 
              republican garb. He took the name Augustus and the title Princeps 
              and became Rome’s first emperor.

          <p class="col-md-12">REPUBLIC OF ROME represents a distillation of 250 years of Roman 
              history, from about 265 B.C. to 44 B.C. Prior to this period the Roman 
              constitution was still taking shape amidst the Struggle of the Orders, 
              and after Julius Caesar traditional Senatorial politics, battered for 
              several generations by the rise of the client armies, are dead. Even 
              within this period there is a sharp change in the political scene with 
              the advent of the Revolution in 133 B.C., when personal ambition 
              began rapidly to overtake concern for the Republic as a primary 
              motivation among Senators. REPUBLIC OF ROME, with its player 
              goal of dominating the state, in fact has more in common with the 
              century of the Revolution, but factional politics were a characteristic 
              of the Senate throughout the history of the Republic.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The game was originally designed as a more or less purely political 
              simulation, with random wars and a given number of governorships 
              providing a typical environment for the mid-Republican government. 
              It evolved, however, into a more historical game, in which the players 
              actually build the empire from scratch and thus develop and change 
              the political environment in which they are competing. The major 
              wars, personalities, events and political developments of the period 
              are reflected in the Forum cards, which are separated into three decks 
              in order to provide a more historical framework. The first group 
              (white) is roughly the period 265-189 B.C., the second (gray) 188-100 
              B.C., and the last (red) 99-44 B.C.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The War cards represent the major conflicts of the period and have 
              been assigned their values on the basis of the actual wars, although 
              these values are to a degree “false”, since in the game they are not 
              likely to occur in exact chronological order. Those that were more or 
              less precipitated by the Romans, such as the Second Macedonian 
              War, have been categorized as Inactive in order to give the players 
              some choice in when to fight them. With a few exceptions the fleet 
              requirements represent necessary transport, rather than naval combat 
              potential. It may seem, incidentally, that the military threats in the 
              game are excessive, what with the potential multiplicative effect of 
              wars, but bear in mind that Rome grew up in a tough world. The 
              hope is that the possibility of a devastating war situation will instill 
              in players something of the national security paranoia that seemed to 
              move the Senate.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The Province cards have likewise been based on their real world 
              counterparts, and here also there is a degree of historical distortion.
              In the game all the provinces are created automatically by the
              appropriate wars, and this was far from being the case with the
              actual Roman provinces. The Senate was in fact loathe to take up the 
              burdens associated with the direct territorial rule and, where it could, 
              avoided taking on provinces, preferring to control areas through client 
              states. We adopted the war-creates-province mechanism because it is 
              simpler. The governorships are also simplified; by the late Republic 
              the posts were automatically filled by the previous year’s consuls 
              and praetors, but we made them elective and lengthened the term of 
              office in order to add more vote stability and political action to the 
              game. “Improvement” of a province simply reflects the development 
              of its economy and infrastructure.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The actual political structure of the Republic is simplified in the game. 
              With the exception of the tribunes all the offices below the consulship 
              are ignored for the sake of playability. The tribunes, with their 
              powerful twin weapons of veto and legislative initiation, could not 
              be ignored, but since ten of them were elected every year it seemed 
              reasonable and far more playable to represent their adherence to a 
              faction with random cards. Further, there were actually two censors, 
              elected every five years for 18-month terms, and they did not bring 
              prosecutions for corruption, as they do in the game. They did have 
              the power to remove members of the Senate for grave misconduct, 
              however, that is what is reflected in their prosecutorial power. A 
              player’s option to appeal to the people during a prosecution represents
              the basic right of provocation, which allowed a citizen to appeal a 
              magisterial decision to the people. The dictator (and his master of 
              horse) was actually given a maximum of six months in power, and 
              the office was resorted to very rarely. The extra voting strength of 
              the pontifex maximus and priests on questions of military expeditions 
              reflect their ability to sway superstitious opinion through control of 
              the religious establishment.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Completely ignored in the game are the Roman citizen assemblies, but 
              until the Revolution these were little more than rubber stamps for the 
              Senate, and after 133 B.C. they were essentially the tools of ambitious 
              Senators. The bottom line is that for most of Republican history the 
              politics of the Senate were the politics of Rome, and not until the 
              Revolution did the people, or at least those who lived in Rome, play a 
              direct political role, and even then it was a limited one. The Roman 
              people are, however, given some influence in the game through the 
              mechanism of the Unrest Level, which was added primarily to provide 
              another distraction for the Senate to worry about. Games and land 
              bills, which provided for Roman colonies and thus opportunities for 
              poor citizens, were in fact used to please the populace, but mostly 
              during the Revolution and essentially to win their support for some 
              individual politician, rather than to stave off a popular revolt. The 
              Roman Republic actually never faced any real possibility of a revolt of 
              the people, but we wanted to put yet more pressure on the Senate to 
              deal with domestic concerns and thereby give the populus Romanus 
              some role in the game.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The heart of the game is the Senate meeting. Throughout most of the 
              Republican period the Senate numbered about 300 and until the 
              Revolution presented a more or less united front in its direction of 
              Roman policy. Behind that front, however, the Senate was a swirling 
              pool of constantly changing alliances among the families that made 
              up the Senatorial nobility. While the Senate as a whole was generally 
              united in common action (until the Revolution) for the good of Rome, 
              at the same time the individual Senators were continually jockeying to 
              improve their position and influence in the body.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Each Senator card represents the current leading member of that 
              particular family, the families included in the game being the most 
              important for the period. The numbers on the cards are historically 
              arbitrary and differ from family to family simply to add variety. One 
              may understand the larger Oratory numbers (votes) of some Senators 
              as representing their control of lesser lights in the Senate. The 
              Statesmen cards do represent historical figures, and their numbers 
              to some degree reflect the characteristics of that individual. But 
              individuals are in many ways shaped by their circumstances, and in 
              that respect these Statesmen are historically “inaccurate”, since in the 
              game they are unlikely to appear in their exact historical environment. 
              This fact is most obvious in the special characteristics assigned to 
              each: as examples, Fabius Maximus halves losses in combat because 
              his “Fabian” tactics against Hannibal reduced casualties, and 
              Sulla’s Loyalty rating is 0 if in the same faction with Marius because 
              historically the two men were enemies—and this game technique 
              encourages their gravitating to different factions.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">In a similar vein many of the Leaders, such as Spartacus, were given 
              the ability to influence Wars/Revolts with which they were not 
              historically associated. This provides for more frequent use of the 
              Leaders, who might match several conflicts rather than just one, and 
              increases the threat potential of most of the Wars/Revolts. One 
              might consequently think of the Leaders in more general terms. 
              Vercingetorix, for example, being a generic good Gallic commander. 
              Further, since Leaders and Statesmen often remain in the game for a 
              long period, they might also be viewed as father-son teams, in which 
              the son carries on the father’s policies.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">We do not know all that much about procedural rules in the Senate, 
              but certainly the Senate meeting of the game is more formal and 
              limiting than what was historically the case. It was necessary to add 
              many restrictions in order to make the game work and prevent players
              from exploiting many unhistorical and game-distorting possibilities 
              inherent in a more wide open meeting. Incidentally, the selection of 
              a Field Consul and a Rome Consul has no historical basis, but makes 
              the game easier to play. Further, widespread bribery, represented in 
              the game by the ability to buy votes, was historically limited to the 
              period of the Revolution, but we needed a way for a player to 
              translate economic power directly into political power and thus the 
              exaggeration was allowed.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Many of the economic aspects of the game are also misleading. The 
              Senatorial oligarchy, especially in the years before the Revolution, 
              represented landed wealth, and commercial matters were for the most 
              part left in the hands of the Knights, Senators in fact being legally 
              barred from many business activities. In order to provide more 
              income and more action in the Senate, however, we have allowed 
              commercial opportunities that would have been handled by Knights 
              to be assigned to Senators in the form of Concessions. The Knights 
              themselves were essentially apolitical until the Revolution, but 
              we include them in a manner that reflects the added economic and 
              political influence that accrued to a faction that established alliances 
              within the business community. A tax farmer, by the way, was some 
              individual or group (inevitably Knights) that contracted with the state 
              to collect the taxes of a province; this notorious and corruption prone 
              system was changed after the collapse of the Republic.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Most of the Event and Intrigue cards are generic and serve the 
              standard purpose of adding variety and sudden changes of fortune 
              to the game, although it should be noted that much of the activity 
              on the Intrigue cards is more characteristic of the Revolution. Some 
              of the Events do represent actual occurrences in Republican history 
              as indicated by their dates, and while most are self-explanatory, a 
              few are not. The proscription was used by Sulla (and later Octavian 
              and Anthony) to eliminate enemies and acquire their property and 
              consisted of publishing lists of people who could be “legally” killed 
              as enemies of the state; 2600 Knights died in Sulla’s proscription. The 
              trial of Verres, an obviously corrupt ex-governor, was historically 
              insignificant, except in that it brought into political prominence 
              Cicero, who prosecuted the case. The same can be said of the 
              Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 B.C., which because it happened during 
              the consulship of Cicero is well documented.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">The rules of the political game in Rome changed dramatically during 
              the Revolution, which comprised the last century of the Republic. 
              These changes are represented by the Law cards, which in fact do alter 
              the rules of the game in ways reflective of the changes that actually 
              took place during those troubled years. Perhaps the most important 
              of these is the Military Reforms card, the appearance of which means 
              the game can no longer be won with Influence alone. Many factors 
              led to the direct involvement of the military in the political arena, but 
              the military reforms of the Marius were probably the most important 
              in this rise of the client army, which was more loyal to its general 
              than to the state. What this development meant was that political 
              influence was no longer the end, but only the means to gain military 
              support, which had become the ultimate and only secure form of 
              political power.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Of the possible ways to win the game, gaining supremacy through 
              influence is the only one historically correct for all but the last 50 years 
              of the Republic, since being recognized princes senatus, unofficial 
              leader of the Senate, meant surpassing your colleagues in prestige 
              and influence. In reality of course being princes senatus never meant 
              absolute domination of the state—there could in fact be several 
              principes senatus—but it was as close as you could come. Gaining 
              complete control of the state through a military coup is something that 
              was possible only during the last decades of the Republic, as is the 
              notion of Consul for Life, which in reality presumed you already had 
              a military dictatorship (Caesar).

          <div class="col-md-12 pb-2"><h5><a id="The_Making_of_Republic_of_Rome">THE MAKING OF REPUBLIC OF ROME</a></h5></div>

          <p class="col-md-12">REPUBLIC OF ROME was inspired directly by Livy’s History of the 
              Roman Republic. I had just finished reading the histories and stewing 
              about them for several days. It was clear there was an interesting 
              little game there, but there was a hitch. No political simulation could 
              capture the flavor of Roman politics without some compelling reason 
              for players to put personal interest aside. The trick turned out to be 
              reducing the idea to a solitaire game. Once viewed in this fashion, it 
              became obvious one need only split the single player side into factions 
              and voila! The rest of the rules were pretty easy and only took an 
              afternoon working in my garage to produce a prototype we played 
              that evening.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">This is not to suggest the game arrived in its present state that first 
              evening. My only real contribution, I think, was to see the possibilities 
              of using the game itself as one of the players. We played three games 
              that first night. Each game took between an hour and ninety minutes 
              to finish. We lost the first two to wars, but won the third when 
              Marcus White returned from a Macedonian war with a big army and 
              a belligerent attitude. He earned the honor of being the first person to 
              win a game of REPUBLIC OF ROME.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">The games went quickly because of a rule that permitted a Consul to 
              make proposals without fear of being penalized for a unanimous vote 
              against the proposal. In this way a Consul could drain his opponent’s 
              votes and money with unacceptable proposals before he cashed in 
              with the big Consul for Life proposal. The only thing to fear was that 
              once the groundwork was laid, another faction could jump in with a 
              tribune card and force you to make a Consul for Life proposal with 
              their boy as the beneficiary. We also had no allied armies, no 
              provinces formed by victories, and no historical order for events. One 
              could be sent from Rome as a Governor, but the post was an abstract 
              one.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">My focus at this time was the politics of the Senate (in fact we 
              called the game Senate), not the wars or Rome’s expansion. There 
              were two rounds of card draws at the beginning of each turn, and 
              state concessions were placed face up in the Forum and distributed 
              politically during the Senate phase. We had fewer war cards in play, 
              but with the large number of cards drawn, it was always possible for 
              bad luck to smash the State quickly.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Students of history know that Livy is very unreliable. His works are 
              not so much a true history, but rather a representation of the myths 
              the Romans used to think of themselves. There was little chance of a 
              popular revolt, and Livy’s description of the populace withdrawing 
              to the Sacred Mount is pure fiction. But my point was that this fiction 
              still provided the framework for Senate politics. Sure the revolt was 
              fiction, but who at the time could know it was not a possibility? I 
              suspect the possibility weighed heavily on the early Romans. For the 
              same reasons we did not number the Punic or Macedonian wars. 
              There was not a priori way to know what war would pop up, and I 
              was more interested in the atmosphere of uncertainty than historical 
              truth.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Our gaming group played Senate on and off over about five years, 
              usually as the last game of the evening to fill a short time slot. Players 
              won about half the games, and we considered this about what we 
              wanted.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Then one evening Richard Berthold, our own Professor of Ancient 
              History at the University of New Mexico, suggested we should try to 
              sell it, and volunteered to put the rules in a coherent order. I thought 
              this would be good for a laugh and dumped my STACKS of papers 
              and notebooks crammed with rules and notes on the poor fellow.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Imagine my surprise when a week later Rick said he was done. 
              About this time my wife and I were in the process of moving to 
              Berkeley, California, where my wife had been offered a job as a 
              designer for the University of California Press. Rick thought we ought 
              to start at the top, so he sent the rules off to Avalon Hill. Within a week 
              we got a reply in the form of a letter telling us that Avalon Hill NEVER 
              looks at unsolicited manuscripts and just tosses them in the trash, and, 
              oh, did we think we could send him a prototype to playtest(!)
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Apparently on the way to the trash the rules must have fallen out or 
              something, and Mr. Greenwood couldn’t help seeing that Senate was 
              a card driven game for which he had a soft spot. Rick whipped up a 
              quick prototype and sent it in for six to eight weeks of playtesting. 
              One week later Don Greenwood sent us a contract.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Now things began to take off. Don’s playtesters were getting 
              crushed game after game. My opinion was that the testers weren’t 
              quite understanding how to work together, but it was decided that 
              waiting for players to figure out how to play skillfully might mean 
              many players would be quickly turned off by it. That really wasn’t 
              my concern, but I understand why a game company might consider 
              this a deal breaker. So rules were added to scale back the lethality of 
              the game. The number of card draws were cut back, and penalties for 
              failed proposals were added.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Next I got a frantic letter saying the testing was on the verge of collapse 
              because players were becoming angry when their opponents failed to 
              complete their side of a public bargain. I was asked to come up with 
              a solution to prevent “fistfights from breaking out”. Look, I’ll admit I 
              wasn’t the guy to ask about this. The mere idea that the testers could 
              become so involved in the game as to make violence a possibility 
              warmed my evil little heart. I suggested the solution might be to hire 
              ADULTS to do the playtesting. As you might imagine, this was not 
              the answer they were looking for, and from this point on, I was out of 
              the development loop.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">The rule requiring public agreements to be carried out (<a href="#Rule_1.04.3">1.04.3</a>) was 
              added. As a player of Diplomacy and Junta, I hated it. Oh well, once 
              you create something and turn it loose, it ceases to belong to you.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">The next major phase began with a suggestion from Rick that we 
              might want to tie the game more closely to historical events and AH 
              liked the idea. Professor Berthold began to percolate with ideas and 
              it is from this point that the rules which change the rules date. Now 
              early on we had experimented with permitting players to change the 
              rules of the game by votes in the Senate phase, but had discarded 
              them as unworkable. But the experiment had left a residue of silly 
              proposals we still used for color. A player could be required to wear 
              a clown nose while tabulating votes, for instance. But Rick and Don 
              made the idea work. REPUBLIC OF ROME was about to become an 
              historical simulation as well as a political one.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">Eventually one has to quit fiddling and publish, and so AH put it into 
              print. REPUBLIC OF ROME won the award at Origin that year for 
              best pre-twentieth century wargame. The following year Descartes 
              Games licensed the rules and put out a beautiful version in French.
          </p>
          
          <p class="col-md-12">I have only played the final game three times. Professor Berthold has 
              played it once. I have watched many games, however, and if you ever 
              played the game online, I have probably seen your play.
          </p>

          <p class="col-md-12">Senate was my game when it left my garage, but today many people 
              have had a hand in its development. I have had people ask why, if I 
              was the designer, my name is not more prominently displayed. I 
              must say that it is because I believe that others have contributed more 
              to the game’s development over the years than I. She was my baby, 
              but I turned her loose and others have taken the ideas and run with 
              them.
